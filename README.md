# JS-2DGameEngine
From 2017 when I attempted making a simple 2D game engine in JavaScript as a high-school project. Includes bad code and broken physics, but it works!... sort of.

Note: There now seem to be issues that weren't present when this was created. This includes the background image not showing up until the page is resized and sudden slowdowns that can grind the simulation to a halt for some unknown reason. Things might also break for screen resolutions highly different from full HD. Since this is a 5 years old one-off project, I am not interested in fixing any of this anymore, sorry.

### Live showcase:
- [Example game](https://tomlacko.github.io/JS-2DGameEngine/2D%20Game%20demonstration)
  
  Controls: Arrow keys to move, up to jump, mouse click and drag on objects to grab and move them.

- [Asteroid Dodge](https://tomlacko.github.io/JS-2DGameEngine/Asteroid%20Dodge)
  
  Controls: Arrow keys to move, space to shoot, mouse click to pause/resume.
  
  PS: There is what seems to be a browser-related issue causing the background image to not load until the page is resized.

- [Geometry Dash Concept](https://tomlacko.github.io/JS-2DGameEngine/Geometry%20Dash%20(Concept))
  
  Controls: Up arrow to jump, mouse click to pause/resume.

- [Stress test / engine demo](https://tomlacko.github.io/JS-2DGameEngine/StressTest)
  
  Controls: Arrow keys move the blue ball, WASD moves the big metal ball, Space switches camera to the blue ball and back, holding shift slows down time, CTRL spawns green boxes, mouse click to pause/resume.
  
  PS: There is what seems to be a browser-related issue causing the background image to not load until the page is resized. Additionally, the simulation can sometimes slow down and freeze for an unknown reason.

- [Collision detection test (early development version)](https://tomlacko.github.io/JS-2DGameEngine/OLD%20v.1%20-%20Collision%20Detection%20Test)
  
  Controls: Arrow keys move the red ball, mouse click to pause/resume.

- [Collision resolution test (early development version 2)](https://tomlacko.github.io/JS-2DGameEngine/OLD%20v.2%20-%20Collision%20Resolve%20Test)
  
  Controls: Arrow keys move the red ball, mouse click to pause/resume.
