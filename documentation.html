				<h2>Information</h2>
				<div class="subsection" id="about">
					<h3>About</h3>
					<p>This is my custom 2D Game Engine, made completely from scratch.</p>
					<p>It only supports circular and rectangular objects and doesn't support rotations.</p>
					<p>All collisions are based on real-life behavior.</p>
					<p>This engine has one major problem that I was not able to resolve, which is multiple entities stacked on top of each other.</p>
					<p>In that case, objects will push each other through the ground/walls or glitch into one another.</p>
					<p>This engine partialy depends on jQuery to function.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h2>GAME Instance</h2>
				<div class="subsection" id="game_new">
					<h3>Create a new GAME instance</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>To create a new game instance, you need to use the GAME constructor.</li>
						<li>Inside your custom script file and inside your jQuery $(document).ready function, create a new variable and asign it a new GAME instance using the new keyword.</li>
						<li>Your syntax should look similar to this:  <strong>var MyGame = new GAME(.......);</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Whenever you see MyGame in this documentation, it refers to this variable, which contains your GAME instance.</strong></li>
						<li>Inside the parentheses, you need to specify a few parameters. These are: (canvasID, canvasWidth, canvasHeight, fpsLimit, imageSources, audioSources, callback)</li>
						<li><strong>STRING canvasID</strong> - The HTML ID of the canvas you want to display the game to. Canvas needs to be already created in the HTML.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER width</strong> - The width of the canvas. Use -1 to automatically adjust canvas width to fit the whole window.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER height</strong> - The height of the canvas. Use -1 to automatically adjust canvas height to fit the whole window.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER fps</strong> - The FPS limit of the game. Use 60 for best results. Too low FPS can cause physics problems.</li>
						<li><strong>OBJECT imageSources</strong> - All the images (textures, etc.) the game will need. Create this object beforehand and using this format: {internalName:"url/to/image.png", img2:"test.jpg"}</li>
						<li><strong>OBJECT audioSources</strong> - All the audio files (music, sounds, etc.) the game will need. Create this object beforehand and using this format: {internalName:"url/to/sound.mp3", audio2:"test.mp3"}</li>
						<li><strong>FUNCTION callback</strong> - The function to run when the game instance is created and all images/sounds are loaded. Treat this function as the MAIN function (as it is known in other programming languages.</li>
						<li>Now that you have created your game instance, you can add objects in the game, attach events and run custom scripts.</li>
						<li>Remember to write all your initial scripts in the callback function (or MAIN, whatever you wanna call it). You should create any of your own functions outside the MAIN function though.</li>
						<li><strong>IMPORTANT!!!</strong> - The game starts off in a paused state. You need to write MyGame.start(); at the bottom of your MAIN function to make it start running!</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection" id="game_structure">
					<h3>Internal GAME instance structure</h3>
					<p>Every GAME instance has many properties, some of which are defined by the user, while many others are not.</p>
					<p>Here is a complete list of these properties:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>HTML_ELEMENT canvas</strong> - This holds the canvas element which the game draws on.</li>
						<li><strong>CANVAS_2D_CONTEXT ctx</strong> - The canvas context. Used to draw everything on screen. Can be used for standard canvas functions, like beginPath() etc.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER width</strong> - The current real canvas width in pixels.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER height</strong> - The current real canvas height in pixels.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER midX</strong> - The middle of the canvas width in pixels. Shorthand for width/2.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER midY</strong> - The middle of the canvas height in pixels. Shorthand for height/2.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER canvasX</strong> - The current X origin of the canvas. Higher number coresponds to viewport moving to the left. DO NOT MODIFY, for moving the canvas, use MyGame.moveCanvas(), MyGame.moveCanvasTo() or MyGame.centerCanvasTo().</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER canvasY</strong> - The current Y origin of the canvas. Higher number coresponds to viewport moving upwards. DO NOT MODIFY, for moving the canvas, use MyGame.moveCanvas(), MyGame.moveCanvasTo() or MyGame.centerCanvasTo().</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER setWidth</strong> - The desired width of the canvas. If set to -1, the canvas will automatically adjust itself to always fill the entire width of the screen. Use MyGame.updateCanvasSize() to change this value.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER setHeight</strong> - The desired height of the canvas. If set to -1, the canvas will automatically adjust itself to always fill the entire height of the screen. Use MyGame.updateCanvasSize() to change this value.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER zoom</strong> - The current zoom level of the canvas. Higher number means closer zoom. DO NOT MODIFY, for zooming the canvas, use MyGame.zoomCanvas() or MyGame.centerCanvasTo().</li>
						<li><strong>BOOL staticBackground</strong> - True = background follows the viewport position, false = background stays static. You should use MyGame.setBackground() to change background properties.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER backgroundWidth</strong> - The width of the background image. DO NOT MANUALLY CHANGE THIS!</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER backgroundHeight</strong> - The height of the background image. DO NOT MANUALLY CHANGE THIS!</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER backgroundDistance</strong> - The distance effect of the background. The higher the number, the farther will the background appear to be, when moving the viewport. 1 = background moves exactly with the foreground, 2 = background moves half as much as the foreground, 0.5 = (probably undesired effect) background moves twice as much, similar effect to looking through a telescope.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER speed</strong> - The speed of the simulation. 0.5 = slow motion (half speed), 2 = fast-forward (2x speed).</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER tickSpeed</strong> - The length of each tick in milliseconds (tickSpeed = 1000/fps).</li>
						<li><strong>TIMESTAMP lastTick</strong> - The UNIX timestamp (custom object) of the last tick.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER tickTime</strong> - The time passed between current tick and lastTick in seconds. Used for all motion calculations. Very useful for custom functions that calculate some movement.</li>
						<li><strong>BOOL paused</strong> - If the game is in paused state. Every GAME instance starts in paused state. DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE! Use MyGame.start() and MyGame.stop() functions for starting/pausing the game.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER tickCount</strong> - The complete number of ticks since the game started. Does not get reset and is incremented by one every tick. Can be used for creating objects with unique names each tick.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER collisionCount</strong> - The number of collisions that occured in the current tick. Not used for anything by the engine itself.</li>
						<li><strong>BOOL drawCollisions</strong> - Debug setting. When true, draws all collision points on screen as small red circles.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER cursorX</strong> - The X position of the mouse cursor over the canvas element in pixels. Changes every time the mouse moves.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER cursorY</strong> - The Y position of the mouse cursor over the canvas element in pixels. Changes every time the mouse moves.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER mouseX</strong> - The X coordinate of the mouse position projected into the game coordinate system. Changes every time the mouse moves.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER mouseY</strong> - The Y coordinate of the mouse position projected into the game coordinate system. Changes every time the mouse moves.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER cursorLastX, cursorLastY, mouseLastX, mouseLastY</strong> - Self explanatory. The previous values of all the mouse coordinates.</li>
						<li><strong>OBJECT events</strong> - An object holding all the event functions. You can attach your own function to these events using the MyGame.attachEvent() function, or you can replace it directly like this: MyGame.events.tick = function() {/*Your code*/}.</li>
						<li><strong>OBJECT geometry</strong> - An object holding all the geometry objects loaded in the game. DO NOT MODIFY! Use MyGame.createObj() and MyGame.deleteObj() instead.</li>
						<li><strong>OBJECT entity</strong> - An object holding all the entity objects loaded in the game. DO NOT MODIFY! Use MyGame.createObj() and MyGame.deleteObj() instead.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER numGeometry</strong> - The number of geometry objects in the game. DO NOT MODIFY!</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER numEntity</strong> - The number of entity objects in the game. DO NOT MODIFY!</li>
						<li><strong>ARRAY geomLayers</strong> - All the geometry objects separated into their coresponding layers. Used to optimize rendering. DO NOT MODIFY!</li>
						<li><strong>ARRAY entLayers</strong> - All the entity objects separated into their coresponding layers. Used to optimize rendering. DO NOT MODIFY!</li>
						<li><strong>OBJECT texture</strong> - All the textures will be loaded into this object as CANVAS PATTERN objects, after the engine is finished loading (all done before the callback function is run). The individual names are the same as the names defined in the imageSources object. DO NOT MODIFY! You cannot load any more images after the GAME instance is created!</li>
						<li><strong>OBJECT audio</strong> - All loaded audio elements will be in this object after loading. The individual names are the same as names defined in the audioSources object. Use standard HTML Audio element functions to play / control these. DO NOT MODIFY! You cannot load any more sounds after the GAME instance is created!</li>
						<li><strong>STRING / CANVAS_PATTERN missingTexture</strong> - The default texture which is used, if object's texture didn't load properly or if none is provided. This value is a string containing a purple color (in the canvas color format) at first, but is replaced by a CANVAS PATTERN of a missing texture (defined as base64 image) immediately after it is loaded.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection" id="game_flow">
					<h3>Tick flow</h3>
					<p>Here is a description of all the steps that happen during every tick (in order):</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Cancel all other tick requests (in case there are any) to prevent accidental duplication of the tick loop.</li>
						<li>Schedule the next tick.</li>
						<li>Reset collision count from previous tick.</li>
						<li>Get the time that passed since the last tick ran. Used for all physics calculations.</li>
						<li>Execute the user-specified "beforeTick" event.</li>
						<li>Calculate the new motion and position of all the moveable entities.</li>
						<li>Go through all the entities and check for collisions with all the other entities. The following happens with each pair:
							<ol>
								<li>If the entities are intersecting, separate them.</li>
								<li>If the entities are intersecting at their new positions, continue. If not, skip all this and go check other entity pair.</li>
								<li>Calculate the relative time of collision.</li>
								<li>Push all the information about the collision into a collisionList array.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Sort all found collisions by time of occurence.</li>
						<li>Resolve all collisions (calculate new motions and positions).</li>
						<li>Execute the user-specified "tick" event.</li>
						<li>Render all visible objects on their coresponding layers.</li>
						<li>If the debug setting drawCollisions is enabled, draw all collision points as small red circles.</li>
						<li>Increment the tickCount.</li>
					<ol>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection" id="rendering_layers">
					<h3>Rendering layers</h3>
					<p>Rendering layers can be thought of as different planes of the canvas, or the distance of the given object on the Z axis.</p>
					<p>These layers are used to render all the objects in an ordered fashion, such that the foreground objects will be on top of the background objects.</p>
					<p>Objects in certain layers are treated as purely aesthetic, and will act as non-solid, which means that they will not collide with anything.</p>
					<p>Additionally, Geometry objects and Entities have each their own set of layers, which are then stacked on top of each other in the rendering process.</p>
					<p>This is the order of these layers (from the bottom-most to the top-most layer), as well as their intended usage:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Geometry layer (-1):</strong> Used for background geometry, like background walls. These objects don't cause collisions.</li>
						<li><strong>Entity layer (-2):</strong> Used for entities that are behind the main level geometry. No collisions.</li>
						<li><strong>Geometry layer (0):</strong> Used for main level Geometry objects, like floors, platforms, walls, etc. These objects obviously cause collisions.</li>
						<li><strong>Entity layer (-1):</strong> Used for entities, that are behind the main set of entities (like behind the player). Collisions do work here.</li>
						<li><strong>Entity layer (0):</strong> Used for the main set of entities. The player entity should be on this layer. Collisions obviously work here.</li>
						<li><strong>Entity layer (1):</strong> Used for the entities, that are in front of the main set of entities (like in front of the player). Collisions work here.</li>
						<li><strong>Geometry layer (1):</strong> Used for foreground geometry, like pillars or front walls. These objects don't cause collisions.</li>
						<li><strong>Entity layer (2):</strong> The top-most layer, used for foreground entities, like birds or even custom GUI elements. There are no collisions of course.</li>

				<h2>Object structures</h2>
				<div class="subsection" id="shape_info">
					<h3>Shape structure</h3>
					<p>There are two types of shapes - ShapeRect and ShapeCircle.</p>
					<p>Both shapes are created as an instance of their coresponding constructor.</p>
					<p>Their only difference is, that rectangles are defined with width and height, whereas circles are defined with radius.</p>
					<p>All the other properties are the same, so I will not be making any difference between them.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection" id="shape_new">
					<h3>new ShapeRect(NUMBER width, NUMBER height, CANVAS_PATTERN / STRING texture, NUMBER outlineWidth, CANVAS_PATTERN / STRING outlineTexture)</h3>
					<h3>OR</h3>
					<h3>new ShapeCircle(NUMBER radius, CANVAS_PATTERN / STRING texture, NUMBER outlineWidth, CANVAS_PATTERN / STRING outlineTexture)</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>NUMBER width, height / NUMBER radius</strong> - The width and height or radius of the shape. Both width and height are saved with their value divided by 2, because halves are used much more often than the full sizes.</li>
						<li><strong>CANVAS_PATTERN / STRING texture</strong> - The texture of the shape. You can provide rgb or rgba colors inside a string, or use the rgb() / rgba() functions to generate those automatically. Otherwise, you can provide an image in the CANVAS PATTERN format, all of which are automatically created from all the loaded images at initialization and can be found in MyGame.texture.YOUR_TEXTURE_NAME.</li>
						<li><strong>NUMBER outlineWidth</strong> - Optional value. Objects don't have outlines by default. If you want an outline, set this number to be your desired width of the outline.</li>
						<li><strong>CANVAS_PATTERN / STRING outlineTexture</strong> - Required only if outlineWidth is also defined. The texture of the outline. The same rules as with the main texture apply here.</li>

				<h2>Engine events</h2>
				<div class="subsection" id="event_info">
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>Engine events are one of the most important parts of creating scripts for your game.</p>
					<p>They are used to pass a custom function to the engine, that is then executed every time the given event occurs.</p>
					<p>You can attach a custom function to any of these events using the function MyGame.attachEvent().</p>
					<p>You can only attach 1 function to each event, but this doesn't actually limit you in any way, as you can just call any other function you want inside this function.</p>
					<p>The following section is a list of all the events and their usage.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection" id="event_usage">
					<h3>Event list and usage</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>beforeTick</strong> - This event is fired before every tick is processed. This event should be used only when necessary. For most purposes, the tick event should be used instead.</li>
						<li><strong>tick</strong> - This event is fired every tick, after everything is processed. THIS IS THE MOST USEFUL EVENT. The majority of your code will need to be executed every tick, and so it needs to be located inside the function attached to this event.</li>
						<li><strong>render</strong> - This event is fired everytime after the canvas gets re-rendered. This is most useful for creating custom GUIs or drawing text on screen, because it will be drawn on top of the newly rendered frame. Otherwise everything would get deleted when the canvas gets re-rendered.</li>
						<li><strong>collision</strong> - This event is also very important. It gets fired whenever two objects collide, which means, that it may fire multiple times within a single tick. It passes to your function one important variable, which is the collision result object. This object contains all the important information about the collision, including both colliding objects.</li>
						<li><strong>mousedown</strong> - This event is fired when any mouse button is pressed. It passes two variables - the first is the mouse button that was pressed ("left", "middle", "right") and the second is the original browser event itself, so you can call .preventDefault() on it, if needed. The mouse coordinates aren't passed, as they can always be found stored in your GAME instance.</li>
						<li><strong>mouseup</strong> - This event is fired when any mouse button is unpressed. Everything is the same as with mousedown.</li>
						<li><strong>mousemove</strong> - This event is fired everytime the mouse is moved. It passes three variables - the first two are the X and Y amounts of pixels the mouse was moved and the third one is, again, the original browser event.</li>
						<li><strong>keydown</strong> - This event is fired everytime a key is pressed. It passes two variables - the key's ID and the original browser event. Use the G.key object to compare the key ID against.</li>
						<li><strong>keyup</strong> - Fired when a key is unpressed. Everything else is the same as with keydown.</li>
						<li><strong>windowResize</strong> - This event is fired everytime the window is resized. It passes two variables, the width and the height of the window.</li>

					<p>User engine functions are functions, which are defined as prototype and are tied to every GAME instance.</p>

				<h2>Custom Game Utilities (G)</h2>
				<div class="subsection" id="game_utilities_info">
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>These utilities are not tied to the GAME instance. They are separate functions and constants located inside an global object called G.</p>
					<p>Some of these are used by the engine itself, mainly for collision detection, while others are there just for the user.</p>
					<p>To call any of these functions, use G.the_wanted_function().</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection" id="instances">
					<h3>instances[]</h3>
					<p>This array holds reference to all the GAME instances, that have been created.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection" id="key">
					<h3>key{}</h3>
					<p>This object holds name-value pairs of key names and their ids.</p>
					<p>This is very useful when deciding, which keys have been presed in the engine event "keydown" or "keyup".</p>
					<p>This might look something like this: if(pressed_key_ID === G.key.up) //do something.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection" id="keyActive">
					<h3>keyActive(NUMBER keyID)</h3>
					<p>This function checks a keyStates array to see, if the given key is currently being pressed down.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="subsection" id="isMobile">
					<h3>isMobile</h3>
					<p>This is a simple boolean constant, which specifies, if the user is using a touchscreen device.</p>
					<p>There is a small problem, that if the user is using a laptop with touchscreen display, this constant will also be true, but in general, it is a easy check if the user is using a smartphone.</p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>FUNCTION callback</strong> - The function to run, when the user selects a file.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If the user selects a file, the callback function will be run with three parameters passed to it.</p>

					<p>This function partially calculates the pythagorean distance between two points.</p>
					<p>This function doesn't have many uses. It doesn't return the true distance, because it doesn't square-root the calculated value.</p>
					<p>The only use for this is to save the computer unnecessary square-root operation, when you don't need to know the definitive value. This is possible to utilize when comparing two distances, as you only need to know which one is longer and you don't care about the actual value.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="subsection" id="timestamp">
					<h3>new Timestamp()</h3>
					<p>This is a custom Timestamp object constructor.</p>
					<p>When an instance of this constructor is created, the UNIX timestamp (time in milliseconds) is saved in it (in Timestamp.time).</p>
					<p>It is used for one function, which is described below.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection" id="timestamp_since">
					<h3>TIMESTAMP.since()</h3>
					<p>This function returns the time in seconds that passed since the timestamp was created.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection" id="formatString">
					<h3>formatString(ANY_VALUE value, ANY_VALUE default_return)</h3>
					<p>This function formats the given value in two ways.</p>
					<p>It converts any non-string value (if possible) and it strips away any spaces at the beginning and at the end of the string.</p>
					<p>If the function isn't successful, or if the formated string comes out as an empty string, it returns the specified default return value.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>ANY_VALUE value</strong> - The string (or any other value) to try to format.</li>

					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>Vectors are custom objects, that are defined using the "new Vector()" constructor.</p>
					<p>They are heavily used by the engine to unify and simplify many operations.</p>
					<p>These vectors have many functions defined by their prototype. This means, that every vector "contains" these functions, therefore they are called on the vector itself.</p>
					<p>They can also be defined in multiple ways.</p>

				<div class="subsection" id="vector_normalize">
					<h3>VECTOR.normalize()</h3>
					<p>Normalizes the given vector and returns it.</p>
					<p>Normalizing a vector means setting it's length to be equal to 1, while preserving it's directiong (angle).</p>

				</div>
				<div class="subsection" id="vector_reverse">
					<h3>VECTOR.reverse()</h3>
					<p>Reverses the given vector and returns it.</p>
					<p>Reversing a vector is simply multiplying it's components by -1, which in practice makes it point in the exact oposite direction, while keeping it's length.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection" id="vector_perpendicular">
					<h3>VECTOR.perpendicular(BOOL clockwise)</h3>
					<p>Rotates the given vector by 90 degrees and the result is returned as a new vector.</p>

					<p>If two numbers are provided, each component of the vector is multiplied by the coresponding multiplier.</p>
					<p>The result is then returned as a new vector.</p>
					<p>TIP: To divide a vector instead, use the formula 1/N. For example, to divide a vector by 2, multiply it by 0.5.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subsection" id="vector_average">
					<h3>VECTOR.average(VECTOR vector1, ..., VECTOR vectorN)</h3>
